          My passion for <strong className='bg-purple-500 p-0.5 rounded-md'>technology</strong>  began early, when I realized how it can transform lives and create solutions for everyday challenges. Today, I am in my last year of high school at Sesi Sorocaba school, and at the same time I am studying "Technical Systems Development" at SENAI, where I had the honor of being invited to join the <strong className='bg-purple-500 p-0.5 rounded-md'>development team</strong> made up of outstanding students at the institution, thanks to my effort and dedication. This experience has been incredible and motivates me even more to grow in the field.

          I have always been very <strong className='bg-purple-500 p-0.5 rounded-md'>dedicated</strong> to my studies. For me, a 9.5 was never enough; I always aimed for a 10, not out of perfectionism, but because I believe that giving my best is the least I can do. This desire to learn and evolve has always been with me and helps me face any challenge with determination.

          I believe that the phrase <strong className='bg-purple-500 p-0.5 rounded-md'>"Rest at the end, not in the middle."</strong>  by Kobe Bryant sums up who I am as a person, and that says a lot about me.
